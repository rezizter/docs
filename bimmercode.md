# Bimmercode

## Introduction

I had a few things that were annoying me about my car.
Two things in particular were:

* Having to manually override the stop start function every time I started the car.
* Having to manually put the car into ECO pro mode after each start.

I had a look around and found this could be easily coded out, and there were some other nice features as well.

## Result

I was able to add and change the following using the Vgate Icar Pro and bimmercode.
