# Mount a ext4 disk on a Mac

## Introduction
I needed to mount an old ext4 usb stick on my Mac. and get the error below when inserting the disk into my mac

## Setup
Install macfuse, using homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask macfuse
```

Manually clone and compile ext4fuse
```bash
brew install pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/gerard/ext4fuse.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
make
```

Then create a mount point and mount your external hard drive. If you don't know which drive is the external drive, use diskutil list and figure out which one it isâ€”in my case it was /dev/disk4 (external, physical):
```bash
$ diskutil list 
/dev/disk4 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *5.0 TB    disk4
   1:       Microsoft Basic Data                         5.0 TB    disk4s1
```
 Create a mount point for the disk, and then attempt mounting it there:
```bash
mkdir ~/ext4_mount
sudo ./ext4fuse /dev/disk4s1 ~/ext4_mount -o allow_other
```

Allow the mount
