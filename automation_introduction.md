# Home Automation Introduction

## Introduction
I was looking for quick way to do home automation. I needed traditional light switches
as my family wanted the standard wall switches, and came accross qwickswitch which has a 
battery operated rf switch which replaces the current wall mounted manual switch.

I did not want to use an app or service like hassio, and wanted it connected to homekit on Apple so i could control the devices with Siri.
